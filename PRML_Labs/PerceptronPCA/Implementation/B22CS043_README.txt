The B22CS043_train.py performs training of the dataset contained in the B22CS043_train.txt file and stores
the weights in a weights.txt file.

The B22CS043_test.py file predicts the abels of the tt set based on the weights predicted by the B22CS043_train.py file.

To run the codes,
The terminal commands should be 

1. py B22CS043_train.py B22CS043_train.txt
1. py B22CS043_test.py B22CS043_test.txt

After that, the weights can be seen stored in the weights.txt file and the predicted labels will be printed on the terminal.
